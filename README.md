This repository is for my personal rough files belonging to a larger project looking into the association of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and virulence factors (VFs) on IncF plasmids, from a publicly available database, Plasmid Database (PLSDB). 


The main repositoty is availale at https://github.com/frarrivetti/plasmid_side_project/tree/main

The plasmid filtering R script functions to filter the larger downloaded dataset of plasmids to only single-replicon, circulat plasmids >33 kbp, to sort them into plasmid sub-families, then to produce a text file list of the accession numbers of the sub-families with >200 plasmid members from the database.
